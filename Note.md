# An intentet is simply a wire, and a computer connected directly to a wire is called a server.
# Computers we use are called clients since they are not connceted to the the internet directly.
# Everthing connected to the internet has and address called (IP Address)
# Anywhere where two or more parts of the internet intersect there is an equipment called router, which direct our packets to the internet which help us to get more closer to the internet.
# When an information is sent to the server our computer's IP address will be added to the routers IP address and it will reach the destination, then when the information comes back from the internet the IP address is unfolded to the IP addresses it held when it came first.
# HTTP (Hyper text transfer protocol) s(secure.)
# Three main methods are attached to HTTPS, GET (requests data), POST (submit data to the server), (PUT) update data which is already on the server, and DELETE(deletes our data.)
# 200 - means ok, 201 - ok created, 301 - moved to new URL, 304- means not modified, 400 - Bad request, 401 - unauthorized, 404 - not found and 500 internal server error
# GIT is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files.
# You can snapshot your code history by making a commit.
# git init - initialize local git repository
# git add <file> add files to index
# git status check status of working tree
# git commit commit changes in index
# git pull pull latest version from the remote repository
# git clone clone repository into your local files.
# NPM (node package manager): it is pre installed with Node. 
# Package.js manifest file with app info, lists dependencies (name and version), specify if versions should be updated, create Npm scripts, and is easily created with "npm init"

# You can use JavaScript for different things such as for a browser, interactive user interface using javascript based frameworks like React, it can also be used in mobile development and desktop application development.

# Var is not used since it makes declares a global variable where it can be harmful in some cases.

# JS values were represented as a type tag and was represented as null pointer (0x00 on most platforms)
# In primitive dataypes, values are dircetly associated with memory. (sting,number,boolean...)
# As a result, null had 0 as a type tag, hence the bogus typeof return value(refernce)
